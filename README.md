# Gesture-Controlled Volume Adjustment-System
 This Python script integrates MediaPipe Hand Tracking and OpenCV to create a gesture-controlled system for adjusting the system volume on macOS.By detecting hand landmarks, it measures the distance between the thumb and index finger to set the volume level. Key features include:
1.	Hand Tracking: Identifies hand positions and landmarks using MediaPipe.
2.	Gesture Recognition: Adjusts volume only when the pinky finger is down, ensuring intentional input.
3.	Visual Feedback: Displays a dynamic volume bar and current volume percentage on the screen.
4.	Platform Integration: Uses AppleScript to control macOS system volume.

This program offers an intuitive and contactless way to manage audio levels, leveraging computer vision for practical, everyday applications.
